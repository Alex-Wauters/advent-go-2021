# Advent of Code 2021 in Go

This repository contains code submissions in Go (golang) for the Advent of Code 2021 programming challenges. For previous years, you can browse my other repositories.

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
